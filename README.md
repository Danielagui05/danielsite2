### This is my website about me! I love to talk about things I currently love and can talk about endlessly.

# Some of my thoughts:
### I think that the epitome of beauty is found in the mountains, the forests, the deepest parts of the ocean and in the people that I hold so near and dear to my soul. Despite the distance between me and all of these things now, I know they are around, so that beauty alone gives me peace of mind. I love to love and live to love even more.
