## I like rewatching certain youtube videos, not really because I think they're that good but because I get bored and for some reason they like comfort me, even if said videos are just some mid 20 year olds yelling about some absurd shit. I'll still smile and consume. 

# This is one of my favorite songs, it made me go up north fr.

# Some of my thoughts:
### I think that the epitome of beauty is found in the mountains, the forests, the deepest parts of the ocean and in the people that I hold so near and dear to my soul. Despite the distance between me and all of these things now, I know they are around, so that beauty alone gives me peace of mind. I love to love and live to love even more.
